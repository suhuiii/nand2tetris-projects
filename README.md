# Building a modern computer from first principles

I'm currently working through [nand2tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.com/) and the book the Elements of Computing Systems. Coming from an EE background, the first couple chapters are pretty much revision for me, but I have no idea what's happening after pipelining, e.g. what is in an OS? how to languages get compiled into assembly language? Am excited to be making my way up the stack!
